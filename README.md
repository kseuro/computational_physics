### Physics-068

This repository serves as a functional backup of assignments and projects developed for Physics-068 during the spring semester of 2020.

### Ball Drop Project

This project aims to predict the trajectory of a dropped ball of varying properties. This project will be carried out in phases:

1. Collection of video data for each of the three ball types:
  - White ping-pong ball
  - Red foam ball
  - Black rubber ball

2. From the video data, we use the physics software [Tracker](https://physlets.org/tracker/help/frameset.html) in order to compute the individual ball trajectories.

3. For each set of trajectory data, we develop an interactive algorithm for modelling the trajectory of the dropped ball.
