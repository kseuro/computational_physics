### Physics-068

This repository serves as a functional backup of assignments and projects developed for Physics-068 during the spring semester of 2020.

### Project 1 - Week 1
Computational simulation of the trajectory of a dropped ball via numerical integration

### Project 2  - TISE
Numerical integration and root finding of the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation, constrained by a linear potential.

### Project 3  - HOA
Harmonic oscillator analysis.

### Project 4 - TDSE
Numerical integration and simulation of the Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation using multiple potentials.

### Project 5 - n-Body Sim
n-Body simulation of asteroid orbits using the Sun-Jupiter system as the primary graviational influences.
