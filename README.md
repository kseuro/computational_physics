### Ball Drop Project

#### Problem Statement:
Given a ball in the collection $\{$Red Foam Ball, Black Rubber Ball, White Plastic Ball $\}$, with some properties $S_b$ and Tracker software data target $T$, create an algorithm that accurately predicts that ball's trajectory.


This project aims to predict the trajectory of a dropped ball of varying properties. This project will be carried out in phases:

1. Collection of video data for each of the three ball types:
  - White ping-pong ball
  - Red foam ball
  - Black rubber ball

2. From the video data, we use the physics software [Tracker](https://physlets.org/tracker/help/frameset.html) in order to compute the individual ball trajectories.

3. For each set of trajectory data, we develop an interactive algorithm for modelling the trajectory of the dropped ball.
